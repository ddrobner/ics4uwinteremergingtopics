As defined by Britannica (as they can define it more concisely and better than I can) "Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings". Machine learning (commonly shortened to ML), as defined by Britannica is "Machine learning, in artificial intelligence (a subject within computer science), discipline concerned with the implementation of computer software that can learn autonomously." So in short, ML is when computers can effectively learn on their own, training an AI model with much less human input than traditional AI.
