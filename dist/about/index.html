This was mainly because I made Team 3161&#x27;s new scouting app, <a href="https://github.com/frc3161/muninn"> Muninn </a>, using React Native, so I already had some experience and I thought it would be good to help improve my react skills. I think however, react was really not designed for static sites like this, so ultimately it was more work than it was worth. It did however, save a lot of time with multiple pages, because all I had to do was write the html for the content of the pages, and it would apply the style automatically to all of them. It also has handy things like cooler urls (no .html), and dynamic pages which it won&#x27;t optimize for static content (which I didn&#x27;t use here). Overall I think the tool was just not fit for the task, but I was able to produce a website.</div></div></div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">window.__routeInfo = JSON.parse("{\"template\":\"__react_static_root__/src/pages/about.js\",\"sharedHashesByProp\":{},\"data\":{},\"path\":\"about\",\"sharedData\":{},\"siteData\":{}}");</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/__react_static_root__/src/pages/about.4431b1c3.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/styles.b8fd7dab.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/vendors~main.09045878.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.b663155b.js"></script></body></html>
