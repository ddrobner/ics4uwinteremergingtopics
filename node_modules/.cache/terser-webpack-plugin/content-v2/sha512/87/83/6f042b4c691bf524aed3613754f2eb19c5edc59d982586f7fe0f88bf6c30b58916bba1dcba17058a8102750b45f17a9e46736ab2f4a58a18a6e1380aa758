Notice how Google Translate has vastly improved over the past while? This is because Google Translate uses something called SMT (Statistical Machine Translation), which means that it looks at documents that are already translated between two given languages, and analyzes the vocabulary, structure, grammar and many more things. This also allows it to convert between writing systems Another example of where google uses this is Google Assistant. Google Assistant uses ML for Natural Language Processing, Image Recognition, and many more things. It also takes advantage of Google's ML prowess in other areas too, for example bringing up the correct search results when you ask for something like restaurants near you, or who the prime minister of a certain country is.\")),s.a.createElement(\"div\",{style:{float:\"right\",marginRight:\"18%\",marginTop:\"-12%\"}},s.a.createElement(\"img\",{src:\"https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/09/screenshot_20160927-141653-e1475011476237.png\",style:{width:330}})))),s.a.createElement(\"div\",{style:{textAlign:\"center\",paddingTop:\"1%\"}},s.a.createElement(\"div\",null,s.a.createElement(\"h2\",null,\"Alibaba\"),s.a.createElement(\"h3\",null,\"Source: \",s.a.createElement(\"a\",{href:\"https://bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1536\"},\" Bernard Marr & Co. \"))),s.a.createElement(\"div\",null,'One way that Alibaba uses AI and machine learning is on single\\'s day, which is a chinese shopping holiday (on Nov. 11, or 11/11). They do this in a few ways. One way is with TMall smart selection, which uses AI to help recommend products to users, and then communicates to retailers to increase stock. Another way is with something called \"Dian Xiaomi\". \"Dian Xiaomi\" is an AI powered chatbot which can understand more than 90 percent of customerâ€™s queries according to Alibaba.
